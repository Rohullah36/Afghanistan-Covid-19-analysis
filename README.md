## Afghanistan COVID-19 Analysis
This project focuses on **cleaning, processing, and visualizing COVID-19 data** related to Afghanistan. It is built using **Python** and **Pandas**, with a clear folder organization for data, scripts, and requirements.  

## Project Structure
covi-main/ ? ??? data/          # Raw and cleaned datasets ??? scripts/       # Python scripts and notebooks for cleaning and visualization ??? requirements.txt # Python dependencies



## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of COVID-19 datasets
- Data visualization with charts and graphs
- Modular and well-organized project structure
- Ready for further analysis or machine learning

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
```

## install dependencies

## Data Visualization

This project includes scripts and notebooks that generate **visual charts and graphs** from the cleaned COVID-19 dataset, such as:  

- COVID-19 Cases Over Time in Afghanistan 
- Top 10 Provinces by COVID-19 Cases
- Share of Total Cases by Top 5 Provinces
- Cases, Deaths, Recoveries by Top 5 Provinces

Run the notebooks or scripts in the `scripts/` folder to see the visualizations. You can use Python libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, or **Plotly**.
